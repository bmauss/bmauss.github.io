Normally, I like to start these off with a joke, or have a title that's a reference or a pun (mostly both) but today I want to talk about something a tad more serious.  Nothing too heavy, I promise.  

When I was 21, I was invited to spend Thanksgiving with a lovely family that I had befriended.  In addition to enjoying their wonderful company, I got a chance to meet the very charming aunt of the family, Mrs. Barker.  Although she was not as out-going as her husband, she still carried an air of confidence and dignity.  She seemed like she was cut out of a *Home Living* magazine.  Not a hair was out of place, she was well dressed, and an amazing cook on top of all of that.  

You're probably thinking, "Ok, I get it.  But it's not that uncommon for women to get dressed up for family get-togethers."  While that is true, most women are also born with two arms.  Mrs. Barker, however, was born with none.

Now, I live by a philosophy that if someone wants to talk about something, they'll just talk about it.  Because of this creed, I didn't pry into the particulars of her day-to-day life.  So instead, I simply observed.  It's obvious that she relied on others for many things in her life, but what was astounding was the amount of independence she still retained.  Through yoga and, what must have been hours of practice, she attained extraordinary levels of flexibility and dexterity with her feet.  I was entranced as I watched her chop vegetables, wash dishes, use a fork and knife to feed herself, and elegantly bring a wine glass to her lips.  

I can't even begin to think of how difficult it must have been to develop the dexterity, muscle control, and balance necessary to use her legs, feet, and toes as naturally as you or I would use our hands and fingers.  It was truly amazing and she is one of my heroes for her perseverance.   

All of this being said, there are many things she can't do.  From buttoning up her blouse, to using a computer, she isn't able to do by herself (without great difficulty).  And there are many in similar situations.  From veterans who may have lost a limb in service of their country, to paraplegics, and those who suffer from cerebral palsy.  There are so many ways in which people can lose the usage of their hands, making their lives much more difficult as well as creating a barrier between them and technology that could make their lives so much easier.  

Enter: AI assistance.  Thanks to great leaps in Natural Language Processing, speech recognition programs are more accurate than ever.  Text prediction, while sometimes a nuisance, may be a life saver to someone with cerebral palsy, as they often will struggle with speech in addition to using an appendage.  

One of the most exciting advancements is the usage of AI for eye tracking.  By utilizing image and facial recognition, technology has been created and are being better optimized that track the movement of the eyes to predict what you're looking at and allow you to interact with your computer without having to touch your mouse!  This opens up so many opportunities for people like Mrs. Barker.  Using Voice-to-Text and Eye-tracking, she wouldn't need to contort her body to navigate the internet.  Paraplegics will have greater independence as this technology becomes more accessible.  

The technology is not without it's flaws, however.  Currently, there is no working model that supports head movement.  This means that the user has to keep their head still to be properly calibrated and moving the head will require them to recalibrate.  It also makes using multiple monitors almost, if not impossible.

It will take a lot of hard work and creativity to overcome these obstacles, but it will be a worthwhile endeavor.  Through AI assistance, we have the opportunity to help people in more ways than just simply recommending a product to someone.  It has the ability to change the lives of people that work so hard to enjoy the same activities we take for granted.
