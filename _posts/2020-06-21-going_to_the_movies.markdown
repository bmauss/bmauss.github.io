I love movies.  Might seem like an obvious statement. Who doesn't like movies??  Well, for a while, me!  

"How could you not like movies?" you might be asking.  To which my response would be "Too much time investment!"  It reminds me of a sketch from an old TV show called "A Bit of Frye and Laurie" where Stephen Frye is being yelled at by Hugh Laurie and when asked for a response, Frye stands up and begins to walk away.  When asked why he was leaving, he politely states, "I have an estimated 40 years left on this Earth and I don't intend on spending another minute of it arguing with an old gas bag like you."  

That was pretty much my attitude toward movies for a lot of my teenage years, until I met my college roommate, who would later become my closest friend.  We made a list of movies that were either cult classics, or Oscar winners and decided we'd watch them all and determine if they were worth all of the hype.  From films like "Unforgiven" and "One Flew Over the Coo-Coo's Nest", to avant garde films from the creative mind of David Lynch like "Eraserhead", we watched most of them and have commited to watching the rest.

Our consensus on the Oscar Award winning films was that, generally, their praise was warranted.  The combination of writing, direction, the acting, the editing, and filmography changed what I used to view as sitting for two hours into an experience and at times a case study on humanity.  

So, naturally, I was excited when we were told about our project to study the movie industry. I already had some knowledge about different aspects of the industry.  I knew that January was the month that studios dump their garbage into the theaters with hopes of making some sort of return on investments they had given up on.  I knew that summer was extremely popular to release movies, and I also knew that fall was when the Oscar contenders were released.  That's what I was interested in.  I wanted to see what kind of profits you would see during the Oscar season.  

After hours of cleaning, joining tables, and making calculations, these were my results:

Summer, of course, took the cake for most profitable, specifically May and June.  Schools out and your key demographic is restless and wants some entertainment.  The icing on the cake is that their parents want them out of their hair for a little bit and will be willing to pay for it! 

The holiday season comes in at a close second.  The in-laws are in town.  Kids are visiting home from college.  Inevitably someone asks, "You guys want to go see a movie?"  

January is abysmal, as expected.  People are trying to replenish their bank accounts after spending a little too much on gifts for the holidays.

All is right with the world.  Except for fall.  Oscar season.  Why are profits during during the fall so low?  In fall of 2019 alone you had critically acclaimed movies like "Joker", "The Lighthouse", and "Ford v Ferrari".  While, yes, these films were profitable, the sample size I drew from was over 3,000 and had movies dating back to 1916. So my question then changed from "how profitable is the Oscar season?" to "Why would studios release some of their best work during what is historically an unproffitable time?"

One reason I can think of is that these strong hitters are there to keep Hollywood alive until November.  We see in the graph that there is a steep drop off in profits from July to August as people start to spend their money on Back-to-School supplies.  Perhaps studios use the Oscar season as a way to bring some revenue back into the system to keep them going until they push out their holiday hits.

Another reason, I think, is that these filmakers who view cinema as not only entertainment, but as a form of artistic expression, don't want their subtle, and often powerful statements, to be looked overshadowed by the loud specticle of the big-budget fireworks show that is the summer blockbuster.  Who's going to want to watch a black-and-white film about two lighthouse keepers going crazy, when they can see "Spider-Man: Far From Home"?  Both are fantastic movies, but it's clear that originality and the efforts of the entire cast and crew of "The Lighthouse" would go to waste if it was on the same marquee as Spider-Man.  

It seems to me that the studios feel that it's best to save these gems for a time when people have slowed down and become more introspective, even if it means making less money.
