It's a question we all ask ourselves at some point in our lives.  Why? Who knows! Maybe because we like to fly by the seat of our pants, as it were.  Go wherever the wind takes us in search of excitement and adventure.  Maybe it's an inability to feel satisfied. Or perhaps, we fear that as we enter our twilight years, we'll look back on our lives and (like Marlon Brando in the classic film "On the Waterfront") say, "I coulda been somebody."


So how did I, a classical guitarist, get into data science? Well, back in 2016 I was pursuing a Master's Degree in Classical Guitar Performance when I was getting a constant nagging feeling that I was getting too specialized in an incredibly small market.  This thought caused me to do a little investigating.  I had two routes I could take, the concert route and the educational route.  Then I looked at the best case scenarios for both of those routes using the interactions I've had with professionals and world class musicians.  The results weren't much to my liking.

If I went the education route, I would always be fighting to prove my relevance in the public school system.  Even as a college teacher, I'd most likely need to teach at a couple of community colleges to make ends meet.  If a university position opened up, I would need to compete against other musicians on an international scale who have all been looking for their big break. Even then, I'd seen how my own instructors worked hours upon hours organizing events to prove to the University that they were worth funding.

My look into the concert route was also illuminating.  I spoke with one guitarist who had won a Grammy for his work (they have asked that I not include their name).  He was very accomplished musician who has traveled the world. From an outsider's perspective, he was 'living the dream'.  As I interviewed this man, though, I learned that his success came at cost of most of his free time and time with his family.  He was constantly on tour. When he wasn't on tour, he was teaching at multiple music conservatories in different states, playing private gigs, and had over 400 online students that he was teaching.  Still, inspite of all of this revenue, he still found himself worrying about bills. Very few people have the stamina, drive, and discipline to do what this man does on a daily basis.  I was pretty sure that I wasn't one of them.

If I wasn't going to be able to be a professional musician, what was I going to do?  Very few things gave me the stimulation and satisfaction I got out of learning a new piece and performing it for others.  What other skills did I have.  

I had always been good with technology for some reason, so I thought I'd try the IT world.  I got a job working for a tech support company and after 6 months of telling people to restart their modems at 5AM, I felt like I was meant for something else. So I sought out career counseling.

During this time, I stumbled upon a video about a project by Elon Musk's company OpenAI.  They wanted to make an AI program that could quickly adapt to new environments that were constantly changing.  The medium that they chose for this project was in the video game DOTA 2.  Essentially, they created a bot, but to say it was "just a bot" would be an injustice to its programmers.  This bot would spend 8 months playing thousands of scenarios against itself simultaneously and learning from its experiences.  Pretty soon it learned tactics like 'baiting', making it seem like it was going to lose the skirmish to lure the opponent into playing aggressively and fall for the AI's trap.  The AI soon became a milestone for the world's greatest players to compete against, much like how to become a Grandmaster in chess, you must defeat the super computer.

What made me interested in this wasn't that it was a bot that was beating all of the "Major League Gamers" (don't even get me started on that) or that it had to do with a video game.  It was the observations and comments made by the programmers. One comment they made was the very simple parameters they gave the AI (e.g.: getting points is good, losing health is bad).  They observed that while at first it would follow these parameters, it soon began to deviate and devising unorthodox techniques to achieve its programmed task.  I began to wonder of the possibilities of using AI to tackle actually important problems.  What if we could use AI models to devise plans for countries to come out of recessions? It wouldn't be until later that I learned what Data Science was and how scientists were already doing this very thing!

Another project that caught my attention was that of xenobots.  A project of combining organic tissues and "programming" them to perform a specific function.  These xenobots could possibly be used to clean up oil spills and other contaminants, but they wouldn't even be possible without the Evolution Algorithms to help these scientists speed up the evolutionary process by providing them with the "schematics" that would give them their desired results.  If the scientists would input the functions of different tissues and what they would want the xenobot to do.  The alogrithm would then begin making thousands upon thousands of models until it produced the formula for success.

I decided to try out a little bit of data science myself.  I started the prep-course for the Data Science bootcamp at Flatiron School and I found myself enjoying the process of coding.  Each task was just another puzzle to be solved.  The satisfaction I got from finally solving the riddle was similar to the feeling I got when I would discover the secret to making a different shift while learning a piece of music.

More important than all of that, however, was the feeling that I could be somebody.
