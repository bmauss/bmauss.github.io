COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory infection.  Symptoms vary by type and severity depending on immune system strength and age.  Despite this, most people generally report flu-like symptoms.  While contracting the illness can happen as remotely as contact with an object touched by a person with the sickness, the primary mode of transmission is from person-to-person contact, as well as by airborne germs. 

While everyone is at risk of contracting the illness, it is primarily the elderly and people with compromised immune systems that are at risk of death.

# What States Have the Most Cases?

So, our top 5 states that we'll look into are **California**, **Florida**, **Georgia**, **New York**, and **Texas**.

## How are they currently Trending?

So New York has been on the downward slope and actually seems to have stabilized drastically since spring.  What is interesting is that our **other four states**  have been seeing an **increase in cases starting around mid-June**, peaking in **mid-July**, and **sloping off in August** as we go into fall.  

## What's something that happens during the Summer?

Many crops are picked and harvested in the summer.  According to the United States Department of Agriculture, Texas and California are two of the largest food producers in the country.  Do our other 3 states have profitable farms?

From this graphic, we see that there are some pretty profitable farms in southern Georgia and Florida.  New York has some, too.  There's also a large cluster of farms along the Mississippi River, as well as throughout the Midwest.  Let's watch the spread of COVID-19 starting at the end of May and got through the end of August.  To account for population density, we'll divide the number of COVID cases in a county by its estimated population in 2019 (estimates provided by the US Census Bureau).  **Note**: Because these are estimates, we should interpret very dark areas as counties where a large number of its residents have been confirmed with COVID-19, not as an indication that 100% of its residents contracting the virus.

### May
![may](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmauss/COVID_Forecast/master/images/may_confirmed.PNG)

Notice how in the southwestern corner of Georgia and the northern-most border of Texas there are already counties reporting a large amount of their population as confirmed with coronavirus.  These areas also correlate with counties that have highly profitable farms.  Let's move on to June.

### June

Ok, more of the farming communities in Texas are getting worse, and the virus is making its way up the Mississippi River.  A few more counties in the Midwest are lighting up and the farms along California's southern border is also showing an increase in cases.

### July

It's definitely spreading out from the Mississippi River at this point.  Southern and central Florida has gotten worse, more farming communities in northern Texas and the Midwest are deteriorating, and the virus has hit the Fresno, California area.  Also, North Carolina, another top producer, has gotten much worse. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina isn't looking too good either.  

### August

Ok, if we ignore the fact that the entire southeast coast looks like it's been overrun by fire ants, you can see that the Midwest farming counties are getting worse and the Fresno area deteriorated quickly.

There does seem to be a correlation between the spread of coronavirus over the summer and highly profitable farms.  This doesn't mean that the food supply is tainted, only that the workers are at risk.  In fact, according to American Progress, farmworkers are at higher risk of respiratory infections due to handling aerosol chemicals and pesticides to treat the crops.   

## Who do Farms Hire?

The New York Times states that a majority of seasonal farmworkers are undocumented immigrants (*Farmworkers, Mostly Undocumented, Become ‘Essential’ During Pandemic*, Miriam Jordan, The New York Times).  The organization Student Action with Farmworkers states that 75% of farm workers were born in Mexico. 

What's interesting is that not only has the country of Mexico also been seeing the same summer trend we're investigating.

Earlier we discovered that farms begin increasing in early spring and peak during the summer, let's see what border crossings have been like during that time period.

Although the numbers have been low, if we follow the red line (representing 2020), we find that there has been a steady increase in border apprehensions ever since April.  This does not imply, nor should we infer, that those people crossing the border were all carrying the virus.  We also don't have enough data to know where all of these workers ended up. We cannot infer that all of them began working on farms.  However, if many did end up working on farms, the major threat that it poses is that farms will become more crowded.  Which brings us to our next problem:

## Living Conditions of Undocumented Workers

The United States Department of Labor issues out H-2A visas to a number of immigrant workers every year to help work on farms.  These H-2A workers are considered guests and are entitled to adequate shelter and safe working environments provided by their employers.  Undocumented workers don't enjoy these same protections, unfortunately.  Many live in makeshift, or converted housing, such as this garage.

![living conditions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmauss/COVID_Forecast/master/images/farmer_conditions_nyt.PNG)

Cramped quarters like these make it impossible to self-quarantine or maintain social distance.  This is terrible considering that these people are already at risk for respiratory infections due to their working conditions.

# Arizona

It would be hard to miss the increase in cases in northern Arizona.  Those counties don't have major farms, but there aren't major cities either.  So what is out there?

![reservations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmauss/COVID_Forecast/master/images/reservations.PNG)

Native American Reservations.  It's no secret that Native American Reservations aren't exactly the picture of prosperity.  The living conditions and health care available on Native American Reservations are quite poor.  According to Native Partnership, unemployment on Native American Reservations is 7 times higher than the US.  Homelessness and overcrowding are also major issues due to lack of resources to make proper housing. In the Navajo Nation, 15% of homes lack water, and about 33% of homes do not have adequate plumbing, kitchen facilities, and bedrooms.  All of these factors add up to Native Americans being at a much higher risk of catching and spreading coronavirus.

According to the CDC, Native Americans have the most hospitalizations for coronavirus out of all of the other demographics.  So the rapid spread of coronavirus and increase in cases in Arizona can most likely be attributed to the terrible living conditions of Native Americans. 

## The Root of the Problem

So far what has been mentioned are only the symptoms of a much bigger problem.  This infographic from the CDC points out this underlying factor to the spread of COVID-19: Socioeconomic Inequality.  People of color, on average, are at a much higher risk of contracting illness overall (let alone COVID-19) due to health care being too expensive.  Also, the  fear of not making enough money to pay the bills keeps them working when they should be home at resting when they're sick, leading to an increase in spread.  High rent prices lead to multiple families sharing the same home, again, making quarantine and social distancing impossible.

## Solutions

* Improved shelter and working conditions for ALL farm workers regardless of citizenship status
* Working together with Tribal Authorities to bring jobs to Native American Reservations. Particularly jobs that will help with housing, plumbing, and other amenities.  
* Improving the socioeconomic conditions for people of color needs to be made a top priority.

If we are going to get rid of this virus, and come out of this pandemic as a better country and better citizens, we need to take care of eachother.
